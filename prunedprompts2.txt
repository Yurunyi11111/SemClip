An image taken on a snowy, glittering night
An image taken on a foggy, obscured night
An image taken on a cloudy, dim night
An image taken on a rainy, reflective night
An image taken on a stormy, flashing night
An image taken on a snowy, gleaming day
An image taken on a foggy, shadowy day
An image taken on a cloudy, muted day
An image taken on a rainy, glistening day
An image taken on a stormy, darkened day
An image taken on a snowy, sparkling evening
An image taken on a foggy, veiled evening
An image taken on a cloudy, dusky evening
An image taken on a rainy, streaked evening
An image taken on a stormy, flickering evening
